*** Most Updated Branch:
The most up to date branch is the master. 

*** Note on Different Branches:
All branches are merged into master. The branches are snapshots at different stages of development. Technically, not necessary since I can revert to previous commits. However, using branches makes it easier for deploying code on AWS. 

*** Future To Do: 
+ Delete branches I no longer need. Specificaly, delete equal_training, increase_classes, moreLayers. These branches are already fully in-use in the master, so there is no need to revert to these previous states easily. If we wanted to, we always could through previous commits.
