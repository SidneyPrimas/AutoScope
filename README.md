***Abstract***
Over 200 million urine tests are ordered each year in the US alone. Due to the cost and complexity of microscopic urinalysis tests, the majority are conducted at a central medical lab instead of the point-of-care. The AutoScope is an automated, low-cost microscopic urinalysis system that can accurately quantify red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs) at the point-of-care. Even without any magnification, we achieved sensitivity, specificity, and R-squared values that are comparable (and mostly better) than the same metrics for the iQ-200, a $100,000-$150,000 state-of-the-art semi-automated urinalysis system. Specifically, the AutoScopeâ€™s particle counts and the reference particle counts (cross-validated through medical laboratory results) were linearly correlated to each other (r2= 0.980) for RBCs and WBCs. Furthermore, the AutoScope has an estimated sensitivity of 88% (RBCs) and 91% (WBCs) and an estimated specificity of 89% (RBCs) and 97% (WBCs).
